**Example CSV:**
```csv
DisplayName,Email

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Information About Guest Invitations

After running the script, **guest users will receive an invitation email**. It is critical that these invitations are accepted by the recipients. 

### Why is this important?
- Accepting the invitation is required for the guest users to gain access to the resources and functionality provided by the access package.
- Once the invitation is accepted, users will be able to see and access the assigned resources in their **My Apps portal**:  
  [https://myapplications.microsoft.com](https://myapplications.microsoft.com)

### Expected Behavior
- It may take up to **1 hour** for the access package assignment to apply after the invitation is accepted.
- This is normal and does not require troubleshooting.
